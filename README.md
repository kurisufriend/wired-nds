libnds audio player modeled after fauux's lain fansite

# this repo does not include the libnds source!
## the entire devkitPro nds-dev ecosystem should be installed, but this program specifically uses maxmod and various nds.h headers
if you /really/ want to compile entirely from source, libnds is located [here](https://github.com/devkitPro/libnds). it shouldn't be hard to adapt it yourself.
